# INSATxGCS (IxG) : Accelerating Planning On Graphs of Convex Sets by Interleaving Graph Search and Trajectory Optimization

INterleaved Search And Trajectory optimization (INSAT) [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.12548), [[2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08627) is an algorithmic framework that combines graph search with trajectory optimization for kinodynamic planning in continuous non-convex spaces. Graphs of Convex Sets (GCS) [[3]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11565), [[4]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04422) is an optimization-based planning algorithm that optimizes over a graph made of convex sets as nodes to find continuous trajectories. IxG is a GCS accelerator that proposes INSAT as a solver for planning on the graph of convex sets.
